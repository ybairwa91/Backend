//NODEJS
  .Nodejs is a js runtime built on google open source V8 javascript engine
  Contains all the necessary tools to run the js code
  {JS RUNTIME
    .A container where Js code can be executed outside of the browser}

    .lets understand a basic scenario where u want to run javascript outside of your browser and run the code at anywhere else in your system
    does it even possible? answer is YES-->using Nodejs and we will do the same .

    .it is done by the assistance of V8 Js engine who does all the job.
    .in a nutshell its right to say that  js on the server is nodejs

    .Single threaded
    .based on event driven
    .non blocking I/O model

//USE CASES
  .Perfect for building fast and scalable data intensive apps
  .used by uber,paypal,netflix
  using for data streaming[stream property of nodejs],real time chatapp,
  server side webapp,api with database behind it.

//CONS
  .application with heavy server side processing[cpu intensive] then we dont use nodejs
  .Heavy processing doesn't handle by nodejs
