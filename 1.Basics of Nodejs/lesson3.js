/*
//Modules 
 .set of function u want to include in your application is modules
 .means someone made ur work easy by already created or defined some functions which enhance ur application capablities
 .in nodejs we can create our own modules along with built in one
 .so we do have 2 type of modules one is built-in and another is own modules



//INSTALL BUILT-IN 
  const fs =require('fs');
       here fs is file system built-in module and we use using require
       so require function and calling the module name in '' and store into a 
       variable which has a same name as module(convention)
  
   lets install another module called http
   how lets see
   const http=require('http');
